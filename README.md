This project is an academic exercise with two main components:
1. Practical Part - An implementation of an AVL Tree in Python 3.13.

Each node contains:
-Key: unique integer (ordering is based only on keys).
-Value: string.

The following operations are implemented for the AVL tree:
-Insert
-Delete
-Search
-Rotations (LL, RR, LR, RL)
-Rebalancing
-Traversal methods


2. Experimental & Theoretical Part - Using the AVL implementation, we run several experiments.
Includes theoretical analysis and discussion of results.
